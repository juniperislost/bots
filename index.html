      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Juniper! I am an aspiring programmer looking to help people
        out and collaborate! I have many interests, and would love to learn
        about other topics. I am 13 (14 on May 18, 2025) and looking to get
        experience!

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <p>Here are some frequently asked questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Q: Is it free?</strong></li>
        <li>
          A: Yes! I have plans on monetizing in the future, but as of now
          services are free. All I ask is you give me a good review if you
          enjoyed working together.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Q: Will I have to host the bot myself?</strong></li>
        <li>
          A: Depends. If I really like the bot, I can potentially host it. If
          not, I am happy to guide you through hosting it.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Q: How complex can the bots be?</strong></li>
        <li>
          A: I'd like to keep the bots simple to medium complexity. I am willing
          to do more complex bots, but rarely.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Q: How long will it take?</strong></li>
        <li>
          A: As long as it takes. I am doing this on my own time, so I will work
          on it when I can. I will try to get bots done, but I cannot promise
          fast delivery.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Q: Can I request custom features?</strong></li>
        <li>
          A: For sure! Just keep in mind I am just one person, I will try to do
          my best but I cannot promise every feature will be added. I will try
          to add as many as I can reasonably add.
        </li>

      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>Here's how it works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reach out to me on Discord (check out the contact section below!).
        </li>
        <li>Give me your bot idea, and we'll talk and plan out the bot.</li>
        <li>
          Work with me as I develop and test the bot, and tell me what you like
          and don't like.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the bot is done, I will guide you on setting it up if needed. I
          am also willing to update bots on some occasions.
        </li>
      </ol>
